Template name:  Hovered tooltip
 
Objective:
To implement a Hovered tooltip functionality in EPUB content that provides additional context or explanations when the user:
- Hovers over a word or phrase or icon (desktop)
- Clicks or taps on a word or phrase or icon (mobile/ touchscreen)
 
Approach:

User Interaction:
- Tooltip appears on mouse hover (desktop)
- Opens on tap/click (tablets & touch devices)

Behavior & Styling
- Tooltip is styled with custom CSS (positioning, arrow)
-JavaScript handles show/hide logic. Supports dismissal on outside click or the Escape key

Accessibility:
-The template will be accessibility compliant with WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
 
Limitations:
JavaScript Dependency:
- Only works in JavaScript-enabled EPUB readers (e.g., Thorium, VitalSource, Radium etc.).
- In non-JavaScript environments such as Mobi, Kindle, Kobo, ADE, and Apple Books, the Hovered tooltip functionality will not work.
